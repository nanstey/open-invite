name: In-memory itinerary edits
overview: Switch itinerary editing to an expand/collapse list where edits are stored in-memory and only persisted when the user clicks the overall Save changes. Add full-width Add Item, enforce one expanded item at a time, autofill new item start time, and move Delete into a dot-menu.
